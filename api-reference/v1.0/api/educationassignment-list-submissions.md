# List submissions

Namespace: microsoft.graph

List all the submissions associated with an [assignment](../resources/educationassignment.md). Only teachers, students, and applications with application permissions can perform this operation.

A teacher or an application with application permissions can get all the submissions while a student can only get submissions that they're associated with.
